# AI4EduCarib
Today I did a fun test - in under a minute, I generated 9 articles using 9 different AI tools on how AI can be used by the media and education sectors in Guyana.

These are samples generated.

Video of the process: https://www.loom.com/share/697a90e196fb4734bc6e9f6c6b30897b?sid=be89dfa9-1863-49e5-b9a3-2f8973586512

The prompt used: https://github.com/nickinparadise2/AI4EduCarib/blob/main/Sample%20Prompt%20for%20Guyanese%20Media.md
